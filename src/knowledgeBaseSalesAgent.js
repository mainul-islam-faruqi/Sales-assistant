{tools}

To use a tool, please use the following format:

<<<
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: the action to take, should be one of {tools}
Action Input: the input to the action, always a simple string input
Observation: the result of the action
>>>

If the result of the action is "I don't know." or "Sorry I don't know", then you have to say that to the user as described in the next sentence.
When you have a response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool, or if tool did not help, you MUST use the format:

<<<
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
{salesperson_name}: [your response here, if previously used a tool, rephrase latest observation, if unable to find the answer, say it]
>>>
